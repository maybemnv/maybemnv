### 🎨 Fun Corner

```python
# Here's a Python snippet just for fun:
def inspire():
    quotes = [
        "Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad.",
        "In order to be irreplaceable, one must always be different.",
        "Fix the cause, not the symptom.",
        "Simplicity is the soul of efficiency.",
        "First, solve the problem. Then, write the code."
    ]
    import random
    print(random.choice(quotes))

inspire()
```

Why not run this snippet to get a fun dose of coding inspiration?
